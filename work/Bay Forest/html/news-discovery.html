				<span class="subtitlep">Discover The Flawless Design, Breathtaking Setting And Unprecedented Lifestyle Of Bay Forest At Bethany Beach. Unlike Any Other Community On The Eastern Shore!</span>
				
				<p>All around the Eastern Shore, a dynamic new community has been the topic of much discussion. That community is Bay Forest at Bethany Beach - created by Natelli Communities and redefining the concept of a master planned community.</p>
				
				<p>Bay Forest is a shining example of why Natelli has long been a respected leader in the homebuilding industry. Always committed to a higher standard of excellence, Natelli creates breathtaking settings, world-class amenities and awe-inspiring homes. Bay Forest is no exception.</p>
				
				<p>The tennis pavilion is just one component of Natelli's overall commitment to building communities of exceptional quality. Other amenities in Bay Forest include a world-class clubhouse adjacent to the tennis pavilion that houses a fitness center, a grille, a recreational swimming pool and a lap pool. The community also has a boat house for community kayaks and canoes, a private marina for swimming, fishing and crabbing, a shuttle to and from the beach, walking/hiking/biking trails and much more.</p>
				
				<p>Natelli selected a highly coveted location for Bay Forest that is nestled along the Eastern Shore&apos;s Indian River Bay among over four hundred picturesque acres. Although secluded and tucked away amid woodlands, meadows and open spaces, the community is just minutes from Delaware's pristine beaches and enjoys close proximity to shopping, dining, entertainment and everyday conveniences.</p>
				
				<p>A shimmering lake and graceful causeway mark Bay Forest's entrance, creating a first and lasting impression that this is indeed a community unlike any other in the area. It's impossible not to notice the impeccable attention to detail, from the community's thoughtful layout to the meticulous landscaping.</p>
				
				<p>The community is comprised of eight hundred homes in secluded enclaves and discrete neighborhoods. Wide open spaces, mature plantings and wooded stretches of land separate each neighborhood, while tree-lined sidewalks interconnect them. Walking paths also put residents within easy reach of Bay Forest's incomparable collection of amenities and recreational activities.</p>
				
				<p>The world-class amenities at Bay Forest are representative of Natelli's unwavering commitment to building not only an extraordinary community, but an extraordinary lifestyle. Although many contemporary neighborhoods offer amenities, none can compare to Natelli&apos;s award-winning designs. The state-of-the-art clubhouse was designed by renowned architectural firm Kishimoto. Gordon. Dayala. and spans over 12,000 square feet. A majestic stone facade leads into a palatial space which houses a club room, a fully-equipped fitness facility and a seasonal grill that enables residents to enjoy pool-side service. A resort-style swimming pool with water slides and a separate lap pool await outside. Adjacent to the clubhouse and designed by the same architecture firm stands the world-class tennis pavilion. The only facility of its kind on the Eastern Shore, the pavilion's manicured landscaping and stone exterior reflect the natural beauty of the surrounding community. The pavilion features a large, screened-in porch and an open air seating area that overlooks four hard-surface, lighted tennis courts where tennis clinics, private lessons and events will be held regularly. Down by the water, the community also has a boat house for community kayaks and canoes, and a private marina for swimming, fishing and crabbing. Other amenities include a shuttle to and from the beach, miles of nature trails and so much more.</p>
				
				<p>The same blend of style, comfort and charm that is evident throughout the community is carried into each and every home. Currently, single-family homes, villa homes and cottage homes are being offered by NVHomes and Main Street Homes. Sweeping floorplans, open, airy layouts and designs that blend rich architectural detail with functional elegance create homes ideal for today's discerning homebuyers. The prices at NVHomes range between the mid-$200s to mid-$300s. For more information call 302.539.2128. Prices for Main Street Homes begin in the mid-$300s. For more information, call 302.539.6278.</p>
				
				<p>Buying into a Natelli community is buying into an award-winning lifestyle. Operating primarily in the mid-Atlantic region, Natelli is a real estate developer and builder with a hard-earned reputation for exceptional communities and unparalleled amenities. Natelli has developed over seventy-five communities, including Sunset Island, Villages of Urbana, Lakelands and Avenel. &quot;Thoughtful Planning, Timeless Design and Attention to Detail&quot; are the hallmarks of Natelli Communities. Their commitment to excellence is evidenced by dozens of local and national awards, including the Urban Land Institute&apos;s &quot;Award for Excellence&quot;&quot; for Avenel in Potomac, Maryland, recognized in 1998 as the best planned community in the nation.</p>
